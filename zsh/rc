# ~/.zshrc - Standard Zsh Configuration File

# This `.zshrc` file uses a **drop-in directory pattern** to make maintenance
# and configuration of the zsh shell:
#
# - **Modular** – Keeps different types of configurations separate (e.g., 
#                 aliases, environment variables, functions).
# - **Mainteable** – You can edit individual files without touching the
#                    main config.
# - **Automated** - A simple loop ensures all files are included.
# - **Simple** – You can enable/disable features by adding/removing files.
